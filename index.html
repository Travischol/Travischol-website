"One of the biggest factors that kept me working with Legacy Music Label was the trust Travis Chol has built over the years. There are so many labels and industry professionals out there, but what makes Travis stand out is his integrity and the respect he shows for everyone he works with. He always keeps the lines of communication open, ensuring that I’m involved in every decision that impacts my work. That sense of trust is rare, and it's why I believe so strongly in the label. Travis's dedication to his artists and collaborators is unmatched, and it makes working with him a truly rewarding experience."
